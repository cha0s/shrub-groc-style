# Pretty docs for Shrubby

This module is an implementation of a [groc](https://github.com/nevir/groc)
style for the [Shrub](https://github.com/cha0s/shrub) project.

You may of course include this into your own project if you like Shrub's doc
style. However, at the time of this writing, groc doesn't support style
modules, so you will want to use
[my fork of the groc module](https://github.com/cha0s/groc). Keep an eye on
[the pull request](https://github.com/nevir/groc/pull/159) to know if/when you
can expect to be able to use this functionality in mainline groc.
